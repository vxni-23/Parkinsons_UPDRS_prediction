# Parkinsons UPDRS Predictor
In this project, our objective is to predict the total UPDRS score for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. We perform the prediction using various regression models. These models are then evaluated on the basis of r-square score mteric to determine the the best one. The dataset for this project is available on **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.
